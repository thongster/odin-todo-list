# odin-todo-list
The Todo List project from The Odin Project's Javascript Course

The hardest project of The Odin Project so far! 

I built a modular task and project management web application called Orbit. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete projects and tasks. The tasks are organized into different projects, both are Class types, and the tasks are sorted into Active and Completed tasks. 

Some core elements I used and practiced were:
- javascript modules to separate logic
- classes, objects, arrays
- factory functions
- localStorage for memory
- dom manipulation

I had a really hard time with this project, which with reflection, came as a result of improper planning. This was the first project I really came to understand the importance of CLEAN CODE. As I wrote more and more functions, it became more and more confusing to continue and more importantly to debug, having to constantly go back to review logic and make sure everything connected properly. 

This led to issues with state/memory of variables, duplicate event listeners, and scope issues.

In the end, I am still very proud of the work I've done here. This was a project I planned the UI first on Figma, then really worked to ensure the user experience was pretty and easy on the eyes. I also wanted the functions and use cases to make sense, for example having the dom refresh to the proper Project when a new task was made.

Improvements can definitely be made with mobile UI, and additional features such as auto-filling existing information when clicking edit, having an archive button to ensure the "Completed Tasks" list doesn't get too long, more general user experience details, and most importantly cleaning up the codebase to not have repeat code. 

Overall I'm very happy with the result. I'll be recreating another todo app with more features and perhaps a different concept to really clean up the code and optimize the experience more.
